	<h1> Scale bug </h1>
	<p> 
		Layers of bark-like, hard and semi-transparent brownish/white-tinted (depending on the species) circular bugs on your plant. 
		They are extremely hard to identify due to their camouflaged appearance and may cause significant yellowing as they suck the sap of your plants.
	</p>
	<h1> Treatment</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Monitor:
			Since no insecticide is effective once the soft or hard shell has formed, monitor your plants for the presence of scale. Watch for the first crawler stage in spring, which is when the insects are most vulnerable; wash and then spray. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Use water:
For minor infestations, use a gentle blast from a hose to dislodge eggs, nymphs, or adults. Dispose in a bucket of soapy water to kill them. Wipe down leaves or stems that exhibit sooty mold.
		</li>
		<li>
			Prune branches:
Cut out the most heavily infested branches or stems and discard in the garbage or yard debris bin. Donâ€™t compost affected plant material.
		</li>
		<li>
			Use natural predators:
Insects that prey on scale offer natural pest control. These include parasitic wasps, soldier beetles, lacewings, and ladybugs. Provide habitat to attract and keep these insects around. Beneficial insects can be purchased at local garden centers or by mail order.
		</li>
		<li>
			Apply horticultural oil:
Organic horticultural oil such as neem oil is effective on eggs, nymphs, and adults, as the oil will coat and suffocate the insects. Provide good coverage for the entire plant. To control overwintering eggs and insects, apply oil in spring before leaves emerge. Several applications may be necessary. Follow instructions carefully, as some plants may be sensitive, and oils are best applied in a particular temperature range.
